The DBMS that we use in this assignment is running somewhere in one of Microsoft's data centers. 
Comment on your experience using this DBMS cloud service. What do you think about the idea of offering a DBMS 
as a service in a public cloud?

The experience of using Azure's cloud service is fine, and setup is fairly easy 
except the part evolving uploading the database. For simple queries the server
responds fast, but for more complex queries the server spends tremendous amount
of time to respond.
The idea of offering DBMS as a service in a public cloud is great, since it 
provides us a way of managing data easily. But it could also be somewhat 
unrealistic because DBMS costs a large amount of computing resource of cloud
server, and in public server it the server would repond very slow.
